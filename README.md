  Purpose of the app: 

This weather app provides the average temperature for the week and allows users to view detailed information for each day. It is a digital weather app that can be accessed by all those who have smartphones, to plan their day ahead. I believe that it can be a stress relief for those who do not have the time to watch or listen to the weather forecast, it encourages responsibility and a good routine.

The app could have a user-friendly interface where individuals input any day of the week suitable to them. Upon entering their suitable day of the week, the app will generate whether it is cold, sunny, stormy or rainy. Users could explore each screen by clicking a day of a week, the minimum or maximum average.
